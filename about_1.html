<h1>Online assessment</h1>
<p>
An online assessment or e-assessment is sometimes used to take (parts of) an assessment. Questionnaires and online ability tests can be completed at home or in a controlled environment.<br>
<h2>The advantages of an online assessment</h2>
The use of online assessments saves companies a lot of time and money. Often the assessments can be completed in less time, multiple candidates can complete the online assessment at the same time and there is no need for specialised (and expensive) personnel. All required knowledge is present in the e-assessment. There is no need for the presence of a psychologist or other expert at the assessment.<br>
<h2>Components</h2>

Questionnaires and ability tests are the most important components of an online assessment. After all, practical simulations and role plays cannot be performed online. The assignments are completed in a secure online environment that is not accessible to others. For some ability tests access to the Internet could be used to achieve better results. In those cases the online assessment is often completed in a controlled room or a room where access to the remainder of the Internet is blocked. The personality tests and questionnaires that are part of the online assessment usually can be completed at home. There are different personality tests you can take as a preparation.<br>
<h2>Reporting of an online assessment</h2>

The review of an online assessment is often faster than that of an offline assessment. Usually you immediately receive the results in your mailbox. After this you discuss the results of the online assessment with an advisor, either by phone or at the assessor's office. Then you can grant (or withhold) permission to forward the assessment report to the employer.<br>
<h2>Preparing for an online assessment</h2>

<p>To get an idea of what to expect you can go online and try some exercises and tests that are often part of an online assessment. If you complete an assessment at home, make sure you do it in a quiet, closed space where you will not be disturbed.

There are a number of things you can do if you have an assessment in your near future. Read more about the preparation for an assessment.<br>
